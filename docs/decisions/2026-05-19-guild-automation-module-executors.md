# Guild Automation reconciles via Module Executors with a Capture / Diff / Apply seam in shared

`packages/backend/src/services/GuildAutomationExecutionService.ts` is a 1238-LOC class that reconciles 7 Manifest modules (Roles, Channels, Onboarding, Moderation, AutoMessages, ReactionRoles, CommandAccess) against live Discord + DB state. A parallel bot-side path lives at `packages/bot/src/utils/guildAutomation/` (`captureGuildState.ts`, `diff.ts`, `applyPlan.ts`) — duplicating much of the same logic with a different Discord write path (`discord.js` Client instead of REST).

We will extract per-module **Module Executors** behind a `Capture / Diff / Apply` seam in `packages/shared/src/services/guildAutomation/`, with a lower `DiscordWriteAdapter` seam so bot and backend both consume the shared executors. Runs remain partial-success-tolerant and reconcile on the next Run via existing `GuildAutomationDrift`.

## Context

- `GuildAutomationExecutionService` mixes Discord REST infra, ID remapping across modules, per-module apply, stale pruning, and Run-record bookkeeping. Deletion test: removing any single module's logic still requires touching this one file.
- Bot has a separate apply path (`packages/bot/src/utils/guildAutomation/applyPlan.ts`, 329 LOC) for the same Manifest. Plan-building logic is duplicated; only the Discord write mechanism differs.
- Drift is already a first-class concept: `GuildAutomationDrift` Prisma model exists, `lastCapturedState` lives on `GuildAutomationManifest`, and `bot/utils/guildAutomation/diff.ts` computes diffs. The capture/diff/apply triplet is implicitly present already — just scattered.
- Tests of any single module (e.g. AutoMessages) currently require mocking infra for all 6 other modules because they all live in one class.

## Decision

Four locked design choices:

1. **Cut line.** Orchestrator owns Discord REST infra (`discordFetch`, `getBotToken`), cross-module ID remapping (`remap*Section`), `GuildAutomationRun` bookkeeping, and parity-checklist defaults. Each **Module Executor** owns Capture, Diff, Apply, and stale-pruning for its module only.
2. **Seam shape.** **Capture / Diff / Apply** triplet. Each Module Executor exposes:
    - `capture(ctx) → LiveState<T>` — reads live Discord/DB state into a typed shape.
    - `diff(live, manifest) → Diff<T>` — computes operations + stale set.
    - `apply(diff, ctx) → ModuleResult<T>` — executes operations, prunes stale, returns result.
3. **Location.** Executors live in `packages/shared/src/services/guildAutomation/`. They depend on a `DiscordWriteAdapter` interface (also in shared). Bot provides `DiscordJsAdapter` (in-process `discord.js` Client). Backend provides `DiscordRestAdapter` (`fetch` + bot token). This collapses the duplicated bot/backend apply paths.
4. **Rollback.** Partial-success + reconcile-on-next-Run. No reverse-op log. If executor N fails, executors 1..N−1 stay live; the next Run's Capture+Diff reconciles. Matches the existing `GuildAutomationRun` schema (`operations`, `protectedOperations`, `error`).

**Enumeration:** seven Module Executors, one per Manifest module section:

| Executor               | Manifest section                                       | Write target                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Roles Executor         | `roles`                                                | Discord REST/Client (create/edit/delete + ID remap source)       |
| Channels Executor      | `channels`                                             | Discord REST/Client                                              |
| Onboarding Executor    | `onboarding`                                           | Discord REST/Client (mostly read, rare writes)                   |
| Moderation Executor    | `moderation.automod` + `moderation.moderationSettings` | DB (`updateModerationSettings`, `autoModService.updateSettings`) |
| AutoMessages Executor  | `automessages`                                         | DB + Discord channel ID resolution                               |
| ReactionRoles Executor | `reactionroles`                                        | DB (`reactionRolesService`)                                      |
| CommandAccess Executor | `commandaccess`                                        | DB (`guildRoleAccessService`)                                    |

## Considered options

### Cut line

- **A. Orchestrator: infra + remap + run; Executor: apply + prune + drift (accepted).** Clean separation of cross-cutting concerns from per-module concerns.
- **B. Thin orchestrator + fat executors.** Rejected: forces each executor to carry its own Discord REST adapter, duplicating infra across 7 places.
- **C. Fat orchestrator + thin executors.** Rejected: executors become pure-data Module descriptors with logic still centralized — weakest seam, smallest payoff, and `One adapter = hypothetical seam` problem (one impl of each executor type means no real seam).

### Seam shape

- **A. Apply-only.** Rejected: loses native drift integration and pre-apply preview. Closest to current code but smallest refactor benefit.
- **B. Plan + Apply (two-phase).** Considered. Simpler than the triplet but doesn't natively produce a Drift; `GuildAutomationDrift` would remain a separate code path.
- **C. Capture / Diff / Apply triplet (accepted).** Aligns with existing `GuildAutomationDrift` model, `lastCapturedState` field, and the bot-side `captureGuildState.ts`/`diff.ts`/`applyPlan.ts` split. Drift detection becomes a side-product of normal flow.
- **D. Hybrid (apply-only for onboarding, plan+apply for others).** Rejected: two interface kinds for one seam adds learning cost without clear win.

### Location

- **A. `shared/src/services/guildAutomation/` + `DiscordWriteAdapter` (accepted).** Both packages consume the same executors. Solves the bot↔backend duplication that would otherwise need a separate follow-up ADR.
- **B. `backend/src/services/guildAutomation/` only.** Rejected: leaves the bot-side `applyPlan.ts` duplication in place. Future-us would re-litigate this immediately.
- **C. Promote `bot/src/utils/guildAutomation/`.** Rejected outright. Violates the architecture invariant in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: backend depends only on shared, not on bot.

### Rollback

- **A. Partial-success + reconcile (accepted).** Matches the existing `GuildAutomationRun.operations` / `protectedOperations` / `error` schema. Drift becomes visible via `GuildAutomationDrift` and the next Run converges.
- **B. All-or-nothing rollback.** Rejected: doubles per-executor surface (each must emit reverse-ops), and Discord API doesn't cleanly reverse some operations (permission edits, onboarding mutations).
- **C. Idempotent retry only.** Rejected: no rollback path means broken intermediate state is user-visible in the Guild between Runs.
- **D. Hybrid best-effort revert per failing executor.** Rejected for the initial design — adds complexity without justification; revisit if partial-success data shows users frequently stuck on a half-applied state.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Each Module Executor is unit-testable by mocking only the `DiscordWriteAdapter`. No real Discord client needed in tests.
- Bot↔backend duplication collapses; `bot/src/utils/guildAutomation/applyPlan.ts` becomes a thin caller of the shared executors via `DiscordJsAdapter`.
- New module types (e.g. a future "Voice Channels" or "Slowmode Policy" module) add one Executor file, not edits in two packages.
- Drift detection is automatic: Capture + Diff produces a Drift result that the orchestrator can persist to `GuildAutomationDrift` without separate code.
- Locality: each module's logic lives in one file under `shared/src/services/guildAutomation/<module>Executor.ts`.

**Negative:**

- Migration cost is real: 1238 LOC backend class + 329 LOC bot apply + scattered diff/capture/remap utilities all rewire. Expect ≥4 PRs to land safely.
- `DiscordWriteAdapter` interface must be designed carefully — wrong methods leak Discord internals to executors anyway.
- Cross-cutting infra (auth tokens, retry policies) must stay outside executors and inside the adapters/orchestrator; risk of accidentally re-introducing the monolith inside one Executor.

**Neutral:**

- `GuildAutomationRun` schema unchanged. `GuildAutomationDrift` schema unchanged. `GuildAutomationManifest.lastCapturedState` semantics unchanged.

## Implementation plan (pilot-first)

1. **Pilot Executor.** Pick the simplest write path — likely **AutoMessages Executor** (DB-only, no Discord REST) — and implement it in `shared/src/services/guildAutomation/autoMessagesExecutor.ts`. Define `ModuleExecutor<T>` and `DiscordWriteAdapter` interfaces. Backend orchestrator calls this Executor; old code path stays for the other 6 modules.
2. **Bot consumer.** Wire bot to call the AutoMessages Executor through `DiscordJsAdapter`. Delete the duplicated automessages logic in `bot/src/utils/guildAutomation/applyPlan.ts`. This is the first cross-package consumption — proves the location works.
3. **Migrate remaining 6 Executors** one PR per Executor, easiest first: Moderation (DB-only) → ReactionRoles → CommandAccess → Onboarding (mostly read) → Channels → Roles (most complex; ID remap-heavy).
4. **Decommission the monolith.** Once all 7 executors are migrated, delete `GuildAutomationExecutionService` and the duplicated bot apply path. Verify the guardrail test in `bot/utils/guildAutomation/` is updated to enforce "no Manifest reconciliation outside `shared/services/guildAutomation/`".

## Amendment — 2026-05-24: cross-module ID remapping and executor execution order

### Status of pilot

AutoMessages Executor ✅ implemented and wired into both bot (`applyPlan.ts`) and backend (`GuildAutomationExecutionService.ts`).
Moderation Executor ✅ implemented and wired into bot only; backend wiring is the next PR.
Five remaining: Roles, Channels, Onboarding, ReactionRoles, CommandAccess.

### ID remapping contract

The orchestrator builds a `roleRemap: Map<desiredId, liveId>` and `channelRemap: Map<desiredId, liveId>` by name-matching desired manifest IDs against live Discord state. It then calls `remapManifestEntityIds()` to produce a remapped manifest where all cross-module references use live Discord IDs, BEFORE passing sections to executor `diff()`.

**Executors always receive a remapped manifest section. Executors must never resolve IDs themselves.**

When the Roles executor creates new roles during `apply()`, the orchestrator receives those new `{desiredId → liveId}` pairs in the apply result and adds them to `roleRemap` / `channelRemap` before processing later sections. This is why execution order is mandatory.

### Mandatory execution order for Discord-write executors

Roles → Channels → Onboarding

Roles executor runs first and produces new role and channel IDs. Orchestrator extends the remap maps from the Roles apply result. Channels executor runs next using the extended channelRemap. Onboarding executor runs last using both extended maps.

DB-only executors (Moderation, AutoMessages, ReactionRoles, CommandAccess) are order-independent relative to each other and should run after the Discord-write trilogy completes.

The Roles executor apply result **must** expose a `createdIds: { roles: Map<desiredId, liveId>; channels: Map<desiredId, liveId> }` field so the orchestrator can extend the remap maps. This is the only output that crosses executor boundaries.

### Recommended sequencing for remaining PRs

1. Wire `moderationExecutor` into `GuildAutomationExecutionService.ts` backend (currently bot-only) — no new executor file needed.
2. `ReactionRoles Executor` — DB-only, `reactionRolesService` port. No DiscordWriteAdapter extension needed.
3. `CommandAccess Executor` — DB-only, `guildRoleAccessService` port.
4. `Onboarding Executor` — one DiscordWriteAdapter write (`PATCH /guilds/:id/onboarding`). Extend `DiscordWriteAdapter` with `patchOnboarding`.
5. `Channels Executor` — Discord write (create/edit/delete channels). Extend `DiscordWriteAdapter` with channel methods. Receives pre-remapped section.
6. `Roles Executor` — Most complex. Discord role CRUD. Must return `createdIds` for orchestrator remap extension. Runs first in the Discord-write trilogy.
7. **Decommission** `GuildAutomationExecutionService.ts` — delete legacy code once all 7 executors are wired.

## Revisit when

- **After the pilot Executor PR lands** — re-open this ADR with concrete evidence on whether the seam shape held up. Adjust before migrating the other 6.
- The pilot reveals that `DiscordWriteAdapter` needs to leak so much Discord state that executors end up adapter-coupled anyway.
- A new Manifest module type would naturally fit a different shape (e.g. requires multi-phase commit, transactions across DB + Discord).
- Production data on `GuildAutomationDrift` shows partial-success Runs cause user-visible degradation that argues for option D (best-effort revert).
- Lucky adopts a different Discord library (currently `discord.js` v14) — would force a `DiscordWriteAdapter` redesign and is a natural moment to reconsider.
